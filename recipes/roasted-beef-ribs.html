    <p><strong>Prep Time:</strong>10 minutes</p>
    <p><strong>Cook Time:</strong>3 hours 30 minutes</p>
    <p><strong>Total Time:</strong>3 hours 40 minutes</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Beef ribs</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Baking tray</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 250ºF.</li>
            <li>Dry ribs with paper towels.</li>
            <li>Coat with salt.</li>
            <li>
                Once the oven is hot, place the 
                ribs on a baking tray in a single 
                layer.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake on the middle rack for 
                3.5-4 hours. (Often they only 
                need 3.5 hours but it depends 
                on the thickness of the meat 
                around the bones). Check on 
                the ribs after the 3.5-hour mark. 
                The oven temperature is quite low 
                so you can afford to cook it a bit 
                longer without ruining them. You can 
                tell they’re cooked when the meat has 
                shrunk and isn’t difficult to remove 
                from the bone. 
            </li>
            <li>
                When the ribs are cooked to your
                liking, remove.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour the fat off into a bowl and
                keep it (it's tallow).
            </li>
            <li>
                Enjoy! Also good cold and sliced.
