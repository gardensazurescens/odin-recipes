    <h2>One of the best methods for steak: start it low, 
        cook it slow, then quickly sear or grill for a 
        beautiful crust.

        <p><strong>Prep Time:</strong>10 minutes</p>
        <p><strong>Cook Time:</strong>20 minutes</p>
        <p><strong>Additional Time:</strong>6 minutes</p>
        <p><strong>Total Time:</strong>40 minutes</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2-2.5 inch ribeye or strip-loin
            /NY strip or porterhouse or bone-in
            cuts
            </li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>2-3 tbsp of tallow</li>
            <li>Oven</li>
            <li>Wire rack</li>
            <li>Baking tray and tin foil</li>
            <li>Cast iron or heat proof pan/skillet</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Choose thicker cuts, a minimum 2-2.5
                inches thick. Anything below this will 
                cook too quickly and are better fried
                (or frozen and air fried).
            </li>
            <li>Place the oven rack in the center position 
                and another below it to place a skillet on 
                (to preheat).
            </li>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 180°F.</li>
            <li>
                Place a large cast iron skillet 
                or heat proof pan in the oven to preheat.
            </li>
            <li>
                This process will kickstart the cooking 
                process and speed up the time it takes 
                to sear the surface. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Line a baking sheet with foil and then 
                place a wire rack on top.
            </li>
            <li>
                Dry the surface of the steak with paper 
                towels to remove excess moisture.
            </li>
            <li>
                Salt the steak on both sides and place 
                the steak on the wire rack.
            </li>
            <li>
                Use an instant-read meat thermometer while 
                cooking to check the internal temperature of 
                the thickest part of the steak. Once 15 minutes 
                have passed, check the temperature and continue 
                checking every 5 minutes until you hit: 90 to 95°F 
                (32 to 35°C) for medium-rare or 100 to 105°F 
                (38 to 41°C) for medium
            </li>
            <li>
                The cooking of the steak will be completed in the 
                skillet and will continue to increase in temperature, 
                so you don’t want to cook the steak in the oven entirely.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove preheated cast iron skillet from the oven and set 
                it on the stovetop.
            </li>
            <li>
                Turn the burner heat to high and add tallow.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sear the steaks on each side in the hot fat 
                for about 2 minutes, or until you've reached 
                your desired doneness (temperature measured 
                with thermometer again). Don't forget to sear 
                the edges of your steak a little bit too!
            </li>
            <li>
                Aim for an internal temperature of 130-135°F 
                for medium-rare or 135-145°F for medium.
            </li>
